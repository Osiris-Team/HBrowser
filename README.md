# Headless-Browser
A headless browser for Java.

## IN-DEV | CONTRIBUTIONS NEEDED!
To simulate a browser nowadays we need to provide all of these web apis: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API
See package `com.osiris.headlessbrowser.javascript` for already implemented apis.
If you are working on a implementation open an issue to keep track of who is working on what and avoid duplicate work.
